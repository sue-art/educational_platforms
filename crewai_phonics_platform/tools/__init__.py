# This file makes the 'tools' directory a Python package.

# Optionally, you can make tools directly available when importing 'tools'
# For example:
# from .base_tool import BaseTool
# from .curriculum_tools import CurriculumStructureTool
# ... and so on for other frequently used tools.

# For now, keep it simple. Users will import specific modules from tools.
