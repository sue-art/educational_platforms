# This file makes the 'agents' directory a Python package.

# Optionally, you can make agents directly available when importing 'agents'
# For example:
# from .phonics_agents import curriculum_designer, content_creator
# ... and so on for other agents.

# For now, keep it simple. Users will import specific modules or agents from agents.
